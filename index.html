    <p>
      This picture, titled Now (Berlin Wall), was taken in 1996 by Alan Cohe. After World War II, Berlin was divided into East and West, the former governed by America while the latter by the Soviet Union.   
    </p>

    <p>
       Imagine living in East Berlin at the peak of the Cold War. On the East, covered in an atmosphere of grayness due to restriction of freedom of speech and slow economic growth, you can only get a glimpse of the West by looking across the Berlin Wall. On the East, everything you lack can be fulfilled. However, escaping is almost impossible. The Berlin Wall was erected by the Soviet Union to prevent escaping from the East to the West, and any attempt to do so almost immediately resulted in death or imprisonment.

           This is the true dilemma: What is more important to you, self-preservation or nourishment to your soul? More generally, is life itself the fundamental pursuit of humans, or can life be risked for preserving fundamental human characters that distinguish man from animals?  Mary Wollstonecraft and Thomas Hobbes each offer a different approach to resolving this dilemma through A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and Leviathan, respectively. 
        </p>

        <p>
            For Wollstonecraft, the dilemma of being subjugated under the Soviet Union’s control is analogous to that of women subjugated under the rules established by men. For her, all power that demands blind obedience is tyrannical and arbitrary in nature. Women are subjected to the tyranny of men because they blindly obey a set of rules that teaches them to prioritize beauty, love, and charm over being virtuous and rational beings (Wollstonecraft:2008, 111).  Similarly, you are subjected to the tyranny of the Soviet Union. You blindly obey a set of rules that constrain your freedom of speech and limit your ability to acquire wealth. The freedom of speech is commonly considered the natural right of man, and the latter is explicitly considered the natural right of man by Locke. In this situation, Wollstonecraft would choose the nourishment of the soul no matter the danger.
        </p>

        <p>
            Conversely, for Hobbes, a rational person with the correct faculties for prudence would always view self-preservation as the ultimate goal. In his framework, East Berlin, under the control of the Soviet Union, is a commonwealth formed for common defense. Although the state's control is oppressive, you will at least be alive if you do not escape. For Hobbes, the right of nature is the liberty to use your own power for self-preservation, so the first law of nature is to seek peace (Hobbes:1994, 80). This cannot be fulfilled if you attempt to escape.
